# README.md file

The README.md file is often the first thing that someone sees when they consider
installing your package. This file is the landing page of your file on package 
manager landing pages like PyPI and Anaconda. And it is your landing page in
your GitHub repository. 

#TODO provide some screenshots of what this looks like 

As such it is important that you spend some time up front creating a high quality 
readme file. This file should be located in the root of your GitHUb repository.  

# TODO find language for this that we used for earth py. The readme file should follow the best practices of starting broad and 
becoming more specific lower down in the file 

This file should at a minimum contain:

### README
 The README should include, from top to bottom:

- Your packages name
- Badges for current package version, continuous integration and test coverage. See [the badges section](#badges) for more information.
- At that top you should include a **short description** of your 
package's goals. This language should **clearly articulate** what the package does using 
easy-to-understand language that is accessible to a variety of users with 
scientific background. Consider a 12th grade level of explanation where possible 
to ensure maximum accessibility of your README file.
- Descriptive links to package tutorials or vignettes.
- Instructions on installing your package. Be sure to include instructions for both PiP and Conda if you have published to both 
- Any additional setup required (authentication tokens, etc)
- Brief demonstration of how to use the package. This description ideally includes a quick start vignette that provides a code sample demonstrating use
- A link to your online documentation
- If applicable, how the package compares to other similar packages and/or how it relates to other packages
- Instructions on how to CITE your package. 

#TODO there is redundant stuff below vs above
**Good/Better/Best Recommendations:**
- **Good:** README with name, description, installation instructions, and direction to further documentation.
- **Better/Best:** All the above plus usage examples, citation information, and CI and/or test coverage badges.

**Better:**
Ideally you should also include a quick-start code demo that provides a quick vignette 
of how the tool might be used. 

The a clear explanation of what your package does, a quick-start vignette and instructions
to install your package provide users with an easy to digest understanding of 
how your package might be useful to them. 

# TODO add some links to tools that do this well (good better best examples here)
# also add some code snippets showing a well documented function or class vs less well


# TODO Maybe add something like the readme file we created for earthpy - 

*that readme bests practices where is starts broad and gets more specific*
