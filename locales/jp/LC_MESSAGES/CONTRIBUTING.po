msgstr ""

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:21
msgid ""
"The Python Packaging Guide is written in myST (a variant of MarkDown and "
"rST) and we use **Sphinx**, a documentation engine built in `Python` to "
"build the HTML version you see online."

msgid "Two approaches to contributing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:27
msgid "You can contribute to the guide using two approaches."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:29
msgid ""
"The first approach is using a local copy of the guide in your computer. "
"This option requires a more involved setup, but allows you to build the "
"guide locally to verify your contribution did not introduce any bugs "
"before submitting a pull request. It is the recommended approach for "
"larger contribution, like writing a whole new section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:31
msgid ""
"The second approach is making your contribution directly in the GitHub "
"website. This option does not require any setup on your computer and "
"while your contribution will still be tested when you submit a PR "
"(continuous integration), it will take longer for you to get any feedback"
" in case of issue. It is the best way to make small contribution, like "
"fixing typos, or if this is your first contribution to open source and "
"the first approach feels too intimidating."

msgid "Forking the repository"

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:35

"Independently of the approach you choose, the first step is to fork the "
"Python Packaging Guide repository into your personal GitHub space. To "
"\"fork\" a repository in GitHub means to create a copy of the main "
"repository, or repo, that you have complete control over and can modify "
"as you see fit."
