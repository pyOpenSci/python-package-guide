"When you develop, work on, and contribute to software, there is more to "
"consider than just writing code. Having tests and checks ensures that "
"your code runs reliably and follows a consistent format is also "
"important. You can use **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous "
"Deployment (CD)** to run tests and checks on your code every time someone"
" suggests a change online in a platform like GitHub or GitLab."

"**Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates the process of running tests, "
"code checks, and other workflows each time code is updated."

"CI and CD streamline software development by automating repetitive tasks "
"and ensuring code quality and consistency. Having CI setup also makes it "
"easier for new contributors to contribute to your code base without "
"setting up all your test suites and other local checks."

"When you’re ready to publish your code online, you can set up Continuous "
"Integration (CI). CI is a platform that allows you to specify and run "
"jobs or workflows you define. These workflows include:"

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:36

"Continuous deployment (CD) extends the CI process by automating the "

msgid "Why use CI"
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:45
msgid ""
"CI can be configured to run a workflow on every commit pushed to GitHub "
"and every pull request opened. This ensures that any changes made to your"
" package are tested across environments before merging into the main "
"branch of your code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:47
msgid ""
"These checks are particularly useful if someone new is contributing to "
"your code. Every contributor's change will be tested when pushed to your "
"code repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:49
msgid ""
"Together, CI and CD streamline the process of building, testing, and "
"deploying code. They aim to improve software development and publication "
"efficiency, quality, and reliability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:52
msgid ""
"All pyOpenSci packages must use some form of continuous integration. Even"
" if you are not planning to go through peer review, we strongly recommend"
" that you use continuous integration, too!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:55
msgid ""
"In the case of GitHub actions (which we will focus on here), CI workflows"
" are running on online servers that support GitHub."
msgstr ""

msgid "CI / CD platforms"
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:59
msgid ""
"There are numerous platforms available for CI/CD. Here, we will focus on "
"GitHub Actions (GHA), built into GitHub. GitHub is the most commonly used"
" platform to store scientific open-source software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:62
msgid ""
"If you use [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) CI/CD, many of the "
"principles described here will apply. However, the workflow files may "
"look different."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:65
msgid "If you aren't sure, use GitHub Actions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:67
msgid ""
"While you are welcome to use the continuous integration platform of your "
"choice, we recommend GitHub Actions because it is free-to-use and "
"integrated tightly into the GitHub user interface. There is also an "
"entire store of GitHub action templates that you can easily use and adapt"
" to your own needs."

"[Appveyor:](https://www.appveyor.com/): Supports running tests on Windows"

"AppVeyor supports operating systems beyond Windows."

msgid ""
"[Travis CI:](https://www.travis-ci.com/) had been a common CI platform "
"choice in our ecosystem. Usage dropped after Travis CI ended free support"
" for open-source projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:77
msgid ""
"[CircleCI:](https://circleci.com/) CircleCI can be useful for automated "
"builds of websites and documentation since it offers a preview of the PR "
"changes."

msgid "Embrace automation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../continuous-integration/ci.md:82
msgid ""
"By embracing CI/CD, you can ensure that your code runs as you expect it "
"to across the diverse landscapes of user environments. Further, you can "
"automate certain checks (and, in some cases, code fixes), including "
"linting and code style. You can even automate spell-checking your "
"documentation and docstrings!"
