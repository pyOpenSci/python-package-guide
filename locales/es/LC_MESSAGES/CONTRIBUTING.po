"The first approach is using a local copy of the guide in your computer. "

"larger contribution, like writing a whole new section."

#: ../../CONTRIBUTING.md:31
msgid ""
"The second approach is making your contribution directly in the GitHub "
"website. This option does not require any setup on your computer and "
"while your contribution will still be tested when you submit a PR "
"(continuous integration), it will take longer for you to get any feedback"
" in case of issue. It is the best way to make small contribution, like "
"fixing typos, or if this is your first contribution to open source and "
"the first approach feels too intimidating."
