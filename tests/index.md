# Tests and data for your Python package

Tests are an important part of your Python package because they
provide a set of checks that ensure that your package is
functioning how you expect it to.

In this section you will learn more about the importance of writing
tests for your Python package and how you can setup infrastructure
to run your tests both locally and on GitHub.

If you expect your users to use your package across different versions
of Python, then using an automation tool such as nox to run your tests is useful. Learn about the various tools that you can use to run your tests across python versions here.
