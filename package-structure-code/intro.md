# Python package structure information

This section provides guidance on your Python package's structure, code formats
and style. It also reviews the various packaging tools that you can use to
support building and publishing your package.

If you are confused by Python packaging, you are not alone! The good news is
there are some great modern packaging tools that ensure that you're following
best practices. Here, we review tool features and suggest tools that might be
best fitted for your workflow.

```{note}
If you are considering submitting a package for peer review, have a look
at the bare-minimum [editor checks](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/editor-in-chief-guide.html#editor-checklist-template)
that pyOpenSci performs before a review begins. These checks are useful
to explore for both authors planning to submit a package to us for review
and for anyone who is just getting started with creating a Python package.

## What you will learn here

In this section of our Python packaging guide, we:

- Provide an overview of the options available to you when packaging your
  tool.
- Suggest tools and approaches that both meet your needs and also support
  existing standards.
- Suggest tools and approaches that will allow you to expand upon a workflow
  that may begin as a pure Python tool and evolve into a tool that requires
  addition layers of complexity in the packaging build.
- Align our suggestions with the most current, accepted
  [PEPs (Python Enhancement Protocols)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/)
  and the [Scientific Python community SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/).
- In an effort to maintain consistency within our community, we also align
  with existing best practices being implemented by developers of core
  Scientific Python packages such as Numpy, SciPy and others.

## Guidelines for pyOpenSci's packaging recommendations

<!-- Might belong on the LANDING page for this entire guide?-->

The flexibility of the Python programming language lends itself to a diverse
range of tool options for creating a Python package. Python is so flexible that
it is one of the few languages that can be used to wrap around other languages.
The ability of Python to wrap other languages is one the reasons you will often
hear Python described as a ["glue" language](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/c-info.python-as-glue.html)"

If you are building a pure Python package, then your packaging setup can be
simple. However, some scientific packages have complex requirements as they may
need to support extensions or tools written in other languages such as C or C++.

To support the many different uses of Python, there are many ways to create a
Python package. In this guide, we suggest packaging approaches and tools based on:

1. What we think will be best and easiest to adopt for those who are newer to
   packaging.
2. Tools that we think are well maintained and documented.
3. A shared goal of standardizing packaging approaches across this (scientific)
   Python ecosystem.

Here, we also try to align our suggestions with the most current, accepted
[Python community](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) and [scientific community](https://scientific-python.org/specs/).

The suggestions for package layout in this section are made with the
intent of being helpful; they are not specific requirements for your
package to be reviewed and accepted into our pyOpenSci open source ecosystem.
