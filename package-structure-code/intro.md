If you plan to submit a package for review to pyOpenSci and are looking for 
some guidance on package structure, code formats and style, then this section is for you. 




If you are looking for a more comprehensive guide to Python packaging we suggest 
you review the following excellent resources:

## TODO: ***** add resource list here *****

```{note}
If you are considering submitting a package to pyOpenSci, or if you are just 
getting started with building a package, you may want to have a look at the 
bare-minimum [editor checks.](open-source-software-submissions/editor-in-chief-guide.html#editor-checklist-copy-template-below-to-use-in-the-issue) that pyOpenSci
performs before a review even begins. 

In general these are basic items that should be in any open software repository.

## Packaging Guide


PyPI also has a [short tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
on how to package a Python project for easy installation.


<!-- 

These checks include several items

- **Sufficient Documentation** The package has sufficient documentation available online (README, sphinx docs) to allow us to evaluate package function and scope *without installing the package*. This includes:
  Get started tutorials or vignettes that help a user understand how to use the package and what it can do for them (often these have a name like "Getting started")
- **API documentation** - this includes clearly written doc strings with variables defined using a standard docstring format -->
