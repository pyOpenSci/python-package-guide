# Contributing File in your Python Open Source Package

## What a CONTRIBUTING.md file should contain

```{admonition} Example contributing files
:class: tip

* [pyGMT contributing file](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [fatiando verde's contributing file](https://github.com/fatiando/verde/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

Your Python open source package should include a file called **CONTRIBUTING.md** located in the
root of your repository (with your **README.md** file).

The contributing file should include information about the types
of contributions that you welcome, and how you'd like to see
contributions happen.

This guide should also include information for someone
interested in asking questions, submitting issues or pull requests. It should have things like:

* Any guidelines that you have in place for users submitting issues, pull requests or asking questions.
* A link to your code of conduct
* A link to licensing information found in your README file.
* A link to a development guide if you have one
