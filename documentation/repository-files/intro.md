# Documentation Files That Should be in your Python Package Repository

In this section of the Python packaging guide, we review all of the files that
you should have in your Python package repository. Your Python package should,
at a minimum have the following files:

The files mentions above (README, Code of Conduct, license
file, etc) are used as a measure of package community health
on many online platforms. Below, you can see an example how GitHub
evaluates community health. This community health link is available for
all GitHub repositories.

Note that Security policy has a yellow circle next to it as that is missing from the repo.

GitHub community health looks for a readme file among other elements when it evaluates the community level health of your repository. This example is from the [MovingPandas GitHub repo](https://github.com/movingpandas/movingpandas/community) *(screen shot taken Nov 23 2022)*
```

[Snyk](https://snyk.io/advisor/python) is another well-known company that
keeps tabs on package health. Below you can see a similar evaluation of files
in the GitHub repo as a measure of community health.
