# CONTRIBUTING file and License

## CONTRIBUTING.md File for your Python Package 

Your python package should include a file called CONTRIBUTING.md located in the 
root of your repository (with your readme file).

### Local development environment information 

The contributing file should include information to support a new contributing 
building your package locally. This includes:

* instructions for setting up a development environment locally to work on your package
* instructions for how the test suite is setup and run 

### Community contribution guidelines
This guide should also include information for someone interested in asking questions, 
submitting issues or pull requests:

* Any guidelines that you have in place for users submitting issues, pull requests or asking questions. 
* A link to your code of conduct
* A link to or include how your code of conduct is enforced.

```{note}
[The mozilla open workshop has a nice outline of things to consider when 
creating a contributing guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/)
```

### License
pyOpenSci projects should use an open source software license that is approved 
by the Open Software Initiative (OSI). OSI's website has a 
[list of popular licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses), and GitHub has a 
[handy tool](https://choosealicense.com/) for choosing a license.

<!-- 
pyOpenSci packages must:

- Contain full documentation for any user-facing functions.
- Have a test suite that covers the major functionality of the package.
- Use continuous integration.
- Use an OSI approved software license.

**Good/Better/Best:**
- **Good:** Include a open source software license with your package.
- **Better/Best:** Choose a license based on your needs and future use of package, plus explain your choice in your submission for review. -->
