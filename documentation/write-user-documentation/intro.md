# Writing user-facing documentation for your Python package

This section walks you through best practices for with writing
documentation for your Python package.

We talk about the elements that you should consider adding to your documentation,
the different types of users who might read your documentation and how to
create tutorials for your package.

Here we also cover sphinx extensions that you can user to make documentation
easier such as:

* autodoc to automagically populate documentation for your code's functions,
classes, methods and attributes (API documentation) and
* sphinx gallery for tutorials.
