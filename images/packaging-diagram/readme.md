# About The Python Packaging Diagram

This diagram was created using a mixture of Adobe Illustrator and then converted to a SVG file for use in InkScape.

The illustrations in the graphic came from Canva which pyOpenSci has a license to use.

## Graphic fonts

The graphic uses pyOpenSci Branded Fonts

We use [Itim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim) for headings and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) for body text.
It is also ok to use [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?query=nunito+sans) for body text (we use that on our website).

## How to modify

To modify this graphic

1. Download InkScape from <https://inkscape.org/> - it is free and open source.
1. Download the Poppins and Itim fonts from Google Fonts (linked above)
1. Open the SVG file in InkScape.
1. Edit as needed
1. Export as a .png file and overwrite / update the existing `images/python-package-tools-decision-tree.png` file for simpler rendering on the website. In the future we hope to support .webp in our sphinx books but this is not available for the time being.
